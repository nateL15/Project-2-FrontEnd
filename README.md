Front End for Full Stack Project
Made with JS, Jquery, HTML/CSS, Handlebars

A tool for making notes about League of Legends champions, users can view
and edit their notes.

Whats next: CSS styling, possible incorporation of game company's API for more
robust information

This was definitely a challenging project for me. Especially the CREATE/DELETE/
GET/UPDATE functions, however after getting those down the rest of the Project
fell into place pretty well. Overall, I find back end work more enjoyable than
front end so far.
